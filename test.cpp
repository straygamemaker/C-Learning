History

Q 1 : What is the name of your language? 
	The language is C++.
Q2:  When/where was it created, and by whom? Was it written to address a particular problem or need? 
	It was created by Danish Computer Scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill New Jersey. It was made to make a more efficient way of coding, but also one that has high level features for optimal organization. It was meant to be an essential upgrade from the regular C coding language. 
Q3: What types of programming is your language primarily used for (ex: web sites, video games, mobile devices, parsing, etc.)? If your language is multi-purpose, provide some examples of different projects itâ€™s been used for. 
	C++ is definitely a multi-use language. It is used for game development, which is the reason I chose it. It is very big in the financial world as well, and large scale web services like Google. Many game engines use C++, including the popular engines Godot, HeroEngine, Unity, Unreal, and many more. The backend of Spotify is managed with C++, as well as big games like World of Warcraft and Counter-Strike. 
Q4: Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start programming in it? At the end of your assignment, provide a list of the names of books, website URLs, or any other resources that relate to your language in particular.
	I think for websites I will be referencing youtube tutorials, w3schools, and codecademy. I will keep track of every link / book I use.

Follow up questions: 
	To install the language, you need a computer of some kind, a laptop or PC. You will need an IDE to actually run and type the code, I am using Visual Studio Code. You will need to install the C/C++ extension in Visual Studio Code. If you are on mac, it is a bit more difficult to run, and I would recommend installing x code. You can install that in the app store, and you will need clang as well, which is a tool for running C. I have seen different recommendations from people online as to the best environment for C++, but generally Visual Studio is the best for its helpful extensions and ease of use. I picked visual studio code because of the recommendations I saw and because I am very familiar with it. You can run programs in the language inside VSC by pressing run at the top right, not debug. Comments in C++ are written: 
// like this for one line

/* or like this
for multiple lines */       keep the stars on the inside of the slashes like a sandwich
